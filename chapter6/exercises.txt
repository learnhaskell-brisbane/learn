1. Without looking in prelude define the higher-order library function "curry" that converts a function on pairs into a curried function, and, conversely, the function uncurry that converts curried function with two arguments into a function on pairs.

When would you use these functions?

(currying)

2. Rewrite [f x | x <- xs, p x] using map and filter

(map, filter)

3. Implement the following functions using what you have learnt in the chapter. Try to make them as short and readable as possible.

length' :: [b] -> Integer
append' :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
flatten' :: [[a]] -> [a]
flatmap' :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]

(everything!)

4. Using folds, define a function

dec2nat :: [Int ] -> Int 

that converts a decimal number into a natural number
	eg. dec2nat [2, 3, 4, 5] = 2345

(foldl, lambdas)

5. Rewrite this simple fibonacci function using scans

fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

(hint: infinite lists and recursion)

6. Convert the following to point free style:

	f x = 5 + 8/x

7. Express fst & snd using curry or uncurry and other Prelude functions (don't use lambdas)

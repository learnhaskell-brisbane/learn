A function that takes a function as parameters or returns a function is a higher order function. Higher order functions are really the essence of functional programming

Curried functions
=================

Every function takes ONLY 1 PARAMETER
Functions that take more than one do so using a clever trick - Curried Functions
Named after Haskell Curry
max 4 5 is really just (max 4) 5
Use t: to see for yourself
	eg. max :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a 
	    is really just
	    max :: (Ord a) => a -> (a -> a)
Partially applied functions are returned when we call a function with too few parameters.
	- They take as many parameters as we left out 
Think of functions as tiny factories 
	- take materials and product something
	- that something can be another smaller factory
	- Google "How I taught my kids functional programming" for a funny Dr Seuss/Sneechers example

SECTIONS

Partial application for infix functions
To section an infix function surround with parentheses and supply parameter on one side only
What out for negative
	- (-4) is not sectioned - it's negative 4
	- Use "subtract" function instead if you want to do this

PRINTING FUNCTIONS

You can't print partially applied function as they aren't instances of the Show type class. Kind of obvious really! 

Some higher-orderism is in order
================================

applyTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
	- Need parenthesis as -> is right associative

Function are the highest precedence.

Except for $ and "."

' is strict - instead of lazy.

$ function application

:info/:i - gives you order in GHCI.

What kind of syntax is this?

[ x*2 | x <- [1..10]]

- | is the output of the list comprehension

: cons evaluates 1 : [3..]

[ x*2 | x <- [1..10], x*2 >= 12]

What can't we say x > 12?

Can you have meaningful variable names in properly abstracted code?

List comprehensions in different languages.

Project Euler - first problem.  Fizz Buzz with ranges.

prob01 = sum [ x | x <- [1..999], (x `mod` 3 == 0) || (x `mod` 5 == 0) ]
